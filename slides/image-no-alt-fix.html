    <li>All <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements <stong>must</strong> have an alt attribute</li>
    <li>The correct alt text depends on what you are trying to convey, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/">Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Tutorials Alt Decision Tree</a> for help</li>
    <li>Everyone benefits from a description in visible text</li>
